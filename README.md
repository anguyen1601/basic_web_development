# basic_web_development

Noteworthy, basic web development files!

* within the PSDs file there are two html files that I have anchored to one another. Opening final.html results in a "home page" style web development. Clicking on the link "print examples" leads you to a display about the products the artist offers. Clicking "home" brings you back to the homepage. I created this as a demo for a future site I hope to create for my artwork!
